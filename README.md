Add Local Admin Remotely
========================

You know, create a local account on a remote computer and add that account to
the Administrators group on that remote computer.

After [downloading and installing][msi], look for "Add Local Admin Remotely" in
your Start menu. Run it as an account that has administrative privileges on the
remote computer, then follow the prompts.

If the account you specify already exists, the password will be set to whatever
you chose. If the account does not exist, it will be created. The account will
then be added to the Administrators group on the remote computer.
